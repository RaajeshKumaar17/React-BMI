This is a simple and responsive BMI calculator built using React. It allows users to input their weight and height, then calculates their Body Mass Index (BMI). The app provides instant feedback by displaying the BMI value along with a message indicating whether the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on the BMI score. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices. To use the app, clone the repository, install the necessary dependencies with npm install, and start the app using npm start. Contributions to improve the app are welcome, and you can check the live demo or additional details in the repository.
